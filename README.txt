Using glm, glfw, and glew libraries this assignment renders a mesh of 2 cubes, called SPINNER and REVOLVER. These cubes can be scaled bigger and smaller
using SHIFT+S to increase the size of SPINNER and SHIFT+R to increase the size of REVOLVER, to decrease the sizes simply click "s" for SPINNER
and "r" for REVOLVER.

The UP,DOWN,LEFT, and RIGHT keys will rotate the mesh, and while holding down the left mouse button and scrolling forward and backwards will move into and out of the scene.

"p" will change rendering mode of the cubes tp points, "w" to lines, "t" back to triangles.
